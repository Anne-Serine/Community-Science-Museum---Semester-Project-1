The Community Science Museum website is an interactive online platform designed to engage primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. This project aims to create an informative and appealing website that reflects the curiosity and intelligence of our target audience without compromising on user experience. The website serves as a gateway to encourage visitors to explore the wonders of the museum.

## Description

This semester project aims to showcase my creative and technical knowledge and skills, encompassing design principles, project management, communication technology, and HTML/CSS development. Emphasis is placed on incorporating the first-semester curriculum into the design, ensuring a seamless integration of content and interactivity.

Careful consideration has been given to the target audience, primarily primary and middle school children and families with young children. The proposed design reflects an engaging and age-appropriate aesthetic, creating a website prototype using Figma. The design prioritizes responsiveness and ease of use on various devices.

The culmination of this project is a user-friendly website, consisting of 4-6 pages that showcase compositional principles, thoughtful typography, and well-considered color schemes. The HTML code is semantic, neatly indented, and supported by external CSS style sheets adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Images, provided in the resources, are optimized for quick download, with a maximum size of 200kb.

Requirements

- The site must have a design that appeals to the target audience.
- The site must have at least 4-6 pages.
- Compositional principles, typography, and colour schemes must be considered.
- The HTML should be semantic and neatly indented.
- The site should use external CSS style sheets which follow the DRY principle.
- The site should download quickly and not be overly “heavy”. Images should be at most 200kb.
- The site should consider WCAG principles, especially regarding hierarchy, navigation, and colour usage.
- The site should be responsive, attractive, and easy to use on various devices.
- The site should show consideration for content strategy and SEO (consider the use of meta tags and alt text).
